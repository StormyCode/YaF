# YaF
Your addicted Friend - A movie and series managing buddy ... _a future story_

### Why another git repository?
All of us teammembers has written some code to simplify movie collection handling at least once.
Therefore everyone created several small projects. Now we want to unite them all and create something __badass__!

### What should _YaF_ be able to do?
Indeed, this a tricky question. We had a little conversion about the problems we faced. Managing all of our media was definitly the first bullet point. So analysing hard drives will be out top most interest. This will concentrate on movies and series in general. After this _YaF_ will help us to get our media a nice look-alike. We want to create or edit nfo data on propose and rename all files in a common way. The last planned point will be to save some individual data, like did I have watched this movie yet, or what is the next episode of a special series. Somehow daily problems everyone of us knows...
